                We chose the imagery and icons in our app due to both their inclusivity and accessibility. The icons are simple and understandable for our users, after all, expenses and banking are already difficult as is. We wanted something all users would be able to navigate and use with ease to ensure security and trust in our app. We made sure our icons and image sizing were just right for everyone. We also did various tests with our colours to make sure the contrast was right for all users.

            <p class="graphics-and-icons__text7">
                We chose to keep our app simple, clean, and calming to meet the needs and preferences of our users. Privacy, complexity, and a lack of accessibility are all problems many people face with expense apps, and we aimed to eliminate these issues. Our clean designs, stable colours and straightforward imagery all foster a welcoming and inclusive user experience.
